My name is Eduardo Panciera, but I go by Pancho. 
I’m deeply passionate about technology and have spent years working across next-generation networks, innovation, and telecom strategy. 
I was born and live in Argentina, though my work keeps me connected with teams and colleagues all over the world.
Outside of work, I keep things simple: I play soccer with friends, I dive into tech projects just for fun, and whenever possible I escape to the mountains to go snowboarding. 
I’m married and have one child — easily the most important project I’ll ever have.
